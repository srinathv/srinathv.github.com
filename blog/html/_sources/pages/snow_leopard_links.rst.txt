XCode downgraded for Snow Leopard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It seems that Apple is only offering *Xcode 3.6.2* for Snow Leopard.  
I found that installing was not trivial.  The installation kept stalling at the 2 minute mark.  A warning stated that I
need to shut down Itunes, even though it wasn't running.  The solution is to *quit Itunes Helper* using the *Activity
monitor*.

Macports

I use Macport for most of my package managment.  I got the `Macport dmg <http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.8.0-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg>`_.


How to change boot volumes
